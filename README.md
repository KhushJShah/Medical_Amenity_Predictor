# Medical Amenity Predictor

## Introduction
The Medical Amenity Predictor is a groundbreaking initiative to reduce the response time of paramedic teams in high-need urban areas across the United States. Utilizing a blend of statistical analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling in R, along with the capabilities of Neo4j for spatial analysis, this project seeks to identify and establish new paramedic service locations strategically.

## Project Background
In emergency medical services, every second counts. Rapid response is crucial in saving lives. This project addresses the vital need for quick medical attention by strategically enhancing the placement of paramedic facilities in areas where emergency severity is highest.

## Technologies Used
- **R**: For statistical analysis, EDA, and predictive modeling.
- **Neo4j**: Using graph database management techniques to determine the precise location for new paramedic service setups.

## Features
- **Statistical Analysis & EDA**: Deep dive into the emergency call data to uncover patterns and severity distribution in urban areas.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using R to identify cities benefitting additional paramedic services.
- **Location Prediction with Neo4j**: Employing Neo4j to calculate weights and determine potential new service locations.

## How It Works
1. **Data Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis and EDA in R to understand emergency call patterns.
2. **Modeling**: Build a model highlighting areas with high emergency severity.
3. **Location Identification**: Calculate potential locations based on model findings.
4. **Neo4j Utilization**: Use Neo4j to pinpoint locations for new setups, optimizing accessibility and response efficiency.

## Future Scope
This project has significant potential for expansion and refinement, including incorporating real-time data and machine-learning algorithms for dynamic location prediction.
