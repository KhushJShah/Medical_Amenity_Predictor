<br/>
This R file comprises of the EDA, and modelling of the dataset US_Accidents. The features of the dataset are:
<br/>
1. City: The City with higher severity proportion.<br/>
2. Street: Respective Streets in the City.<br/>
3. Severity Proportion: The Cities with higher proportion of severity 3 and 4.(S.P = (SUM(S3+S4))/(SUM(S1+S2+S3+S4))); S= Severity, S.P. = Severity Proportion.<br\>
4. Amenity: Whether the Amenity near to the accident exists or not.<br/>
5. Response Time: The average response time of medical services for that city.<br/>
6. Weight: S.P*R.T; R.T. =Response Time<br/>
7. New Amenity: Flag1=The streets with Weight above or equal than threshold; Flag0=The streets with Weight less than the threshold of the Weight.<br/>
